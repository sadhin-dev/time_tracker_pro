I upload or import a excel file where include all employees attendance date time.
Now Separate all employees attendance time with dates.
And also want to identify which date which employees makes late.


Previous AI Response Responding The Request:
I'll help you implement an Excel attendance tracking feature with these key components:

1. Excel File Parsing:
- Use 'excel' package in Flutter for reading Excel files
- Create a file picker to select Excel attendance records
- Parse rows to extract employee ID, name, date, and check-in time

2. Attendance Time Separation:
- Create a data model `EmployeeAttendance` with fields:
  * employeeId
  * name
  * date
  * checkInTime
- Group attendance records by date and employee
- Store parsed data in a list of `EmployeeAttendance` objects

3. Late Arrival Detection:
- Define a standard 'on-time' threshold (e.g., 9:00 AM)
- Add a boolean field `isLate` in `EmployeeAttendance`
- Compare each employee's check-in time against the threshold
- Automatically mark entries as late if beyond the threshold

4. Reporting:
- Create a view to display:
  * Date-wise attendance
  * List of late employees
  * Late arrival count per employee

Example implementation will use packages like 'file_picker' and 'excel' for robust file handling and parsing.
